Before Running:

Wiring Instructions:

TFT Board Pin <---> Arduino Pin
===========================
GND             GND
Vin             5V
3Vo             NOT CONNECTED
CLK             52
MISO            50
MOSI            51
CS              10
D/C             9
RST             NOT CONNECTED
Lite            NOT CONNECTED
Y+              A2 (analog pin)
X+              4  (digital pin)
Y-              5  (digital pin)
X-              A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS             6
CD              NOT CONNECTED

Joystick Pin <---> Arduino Pin
===========================
GND             GND
Vin             5V
JOY_VERT(VRx)  	A1
JOY_HORIZ(VRy) 	A0 
JOY_SEL   		2

- Connect Arduino

Running Intructions:
    1.Wire the Arduino to the TFT screen and the joystick according to the instructions.
    2.Open the client and server directories in the Terminal.
    3.Enter the "make upload" command in the client terminal to upload the client to the connected Arduino. 
    4.Enter the "make" command in the server terminal to create the server executable.
    5.Enter the "./CheckerAI" command in the server terminal to run the server and begin communication with the arduino.
    6.The arduino screen will now refresh and be ready to play the Checker game using the joystick.

Functionality:
    - Move the joystick:
    	 Move around the red box to traverse the checker board
    - Press the Joystick:
    	 When pressed on a box, the box will turn blue meaning that is selected. Now you are able to select a second box to complete an action request which is computed by the server to know whether the move is valid or not.
    -When a successful move is made:
    	The piece will execute the move and the AI will also execute the next move. Now its ready for the player to make their move again.
